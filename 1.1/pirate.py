# the program starts by asking the user their name and what the name of their pirate ship will be
'''
fun fact: to make it easier to put variables in strings, type 'f' in front of a string and when you need a variable, put the variable name in brackets {}
ex. apples = 20 print(f"I have {apples} apples!") and it will print out "I have 20 apples!"
This type of syntax is used throughout this program
