This is just a repository to help store my code for my Computer Science 1 class.  So far, we have only dealt with the turtle module and not much else, but it does look like we will get through a lot.  All of my code for the course will be stored here to allow easy access/editing between my school chromebook and my personal computer. *Some projects may be incomplete because I forgot to upload them.*  For the most part, I try to keep everything in here clean and commented, but it is far from perfect.  

# Python 101
If you are using this for a class, I will also be developing a tutorial to the basics of python (since my class didn't have one) in the tutorial/ folder with different folders covering different topics.  This is still a WIP.

# Important Notice:
As stated in the License file, this code is free of charge and may be used for any purpose.  However, if you submit it as your own work in a class, I (sheepman39) take no responsibility.  That is plagarism and cheating in the academic environment.  I (sheepman39) do not condone academic dishonesty and plagarism of code for a classroom.  If you use any of this in a class, use it to **learn and develop your own code**.  You **MAY NOT SUBMIT THIS WORK AS YOUR OWN AND I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF SOMEONE *DOES* TURN IT IN AS THEIR OWN**.  This repository is so I can organize my code better and to help others learn what code works.
