This is just a repository to help store my code for my Computer Science 1 class.  So far, we have only dealt with the turtle module and not much else, but it does look like we will get through a lot.  All of my code for the course will be stored here to allow easy access/editing between my school chromebook and my personal computer.
# Important Notice:
You are free to use this code for any and all personal use and modify it however you wish.  I don't feel like making a liscence so there you go.  HOWEVER, you MAY NOT use any of this code for any school projects or anywhere else you may be graded.  You may learn from it and try it on your own, maybe take some snipets, but you MAY NOT copy and paste the entire thing and submit it as your own assignment.  That is plagarism and cheating in the academic environment.  I (sheepman39) do not condone academic dishonesty and plagarism of code for a classroom.  If you use any of this, use it to learn and make your own.  And like I said before, you can use this code for any personal use or a personal project, but it can not be used in the classroom unless if I (sheepman39) give express consent.
