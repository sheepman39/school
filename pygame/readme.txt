Hello! 
This is just a folder of me trying to learn how to use the pygame module
It is a bit better for creating games than the turtle module so I just wanted to see how it would work.
I am following a tutorial from this link: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
Most of the work in this folder in the beginning will be from this link and I take no credit in writing it
