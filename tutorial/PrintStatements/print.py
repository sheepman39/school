# Comments in code are great to write down notes to remember what is going on
# In python, put a # in front of a line to make a comment and the computer will ignore it
'''
Using three ' can help make multi-line comments for longer sections
The computer will also ignore everything in these lines

# In python, text is known as a String
# In order to print out a string, use the print command
print("Hello World!")

# Print("Hello World!") will NOT work because print is capitalized
# print(hello world!) will also not work because the message is not in quotation marks
print('Hello World!') # will work with single apostrophes.  As long as the quotation marks/apostrophes match it will work

# Using a backslash \ will tell python to print it literally and not count it as a mark
# In the following line, without the \ in front of " this line would not work
print("A wise man once told me \"Always remember to eat your vegetables\"")
print('I can\'t do that')

# TODO: Print out a 5 line story using 5 different print commands, one of which with quotation marks or apostrophes





# In addition to being useful in quotes, the backslash can also provide different utilities
# \n will start a new line
# \t will create a tab
print("First line \nSecond Line")
print("I wish I was tabbed \t Tabs!")
