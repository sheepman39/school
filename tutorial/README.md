# Welcome to the basics of Python!

## Programming 101
This intro guide will be split up into different topics with a .py file along with a README.md file with instructions and other information.
Python is ***case sensitive and space sensitive***, so when working on this you have to be extremely precise.  
Learning how to program can be very challenging yet extremely rewarding when everything works.  When something isn't working, remember to stay calm and think through the problem.  We will go through common problems and solutions throughout the sections.  The best trick is to stay calm, think about what the error is saying, and double check spelling and capitalization.  
Good luck!
